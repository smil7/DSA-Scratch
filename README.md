# DSA-Scratch
Implementing Data Structures and Algorithms from scratch using Python. This repo can be used as a learning material to learn about Data Strucuters and Algorithms.

### Key Points
- Learning about different types of Data Structures such as Array, Linkedd List, Trees and how to implement them from scratch.
- Learning about algorithms such as sorting technqiues, dynamic programming, etc.
- Preparing for technical interviews.

More algorithms will be discovered and implemented in the future.
